# Python 100-day challenge
## Aim
In this challenge, I would need to (in most cases) block myself from the usage of vibe coding / coding assistant / Copliot what-so-ever, and try to build something by my own mind. The code may not be perfect, and sometimes I need to refer to some dictionaries or tutorials, yet writing in such old-fashioned way could keep myself from being brainrot.
